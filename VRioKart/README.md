# upm-package-template-3DLightweightVR
This template uses the new Lightweight Scriptable Render Pipeline. This is a good starting point for developers focused on performance, and projects that primarily use a baked lighting solution. 
This project requires a Virtual Reality device to run. Make sure you have the correct SDKs for the device you are using before using this template. Visit the Unity XR manual pages for more information.
